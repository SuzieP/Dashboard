##### OBSERVATIONS  

**Of all male candidates 24% receive a job offer.
Of all female candidates 18% receive a job offer.**

##### Is the difference between the actual gender ratio and the expected gender ratio evidence of bias or randomness?

##### Chi squared statistical tests attribute the disparity in the ratios to gender bias and identify the following biases per recruitment stage:
* Screening Stage : No significant gender bias.
* Assessment Stage : Significant gender bias favoring males over females.
* Interview Stage : Significant gender bias favoring females over males. 
* Offer Stage: Significant gender bias favoring males over females

**A male candidate is 1.38 times more likely to receive an offer than his female counterpart**
##### CONCLUSION
**Significant gender bias against female candidates starts at the ‘Assessment’ stage of hiring and snowballs into a staggering 38% favor of men over women.**
